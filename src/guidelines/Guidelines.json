You can add your own sections and format it to suit your needs\r\n\r\nTIP: More context isn't always better. It can confuse the LLM. Try and add the most important rules you need\r\n\r\n# General guidelines\r\n\r\nAny general rules you want the AI to follow.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n* Only use absolute positioning when necessary. Opt for responsive and well structured layouts that use flexbox and grid by default\r\n* Refactor code as you go to keep code clean\r\n* Keep file sizes small and put helper functions and components in their own files.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n# Design system guidelines\r\nRules for how the AI should make generations look like your company's design system\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you select a design system to use in the prompt box, you can reference\r\nyour design system's components, tokens, variables and components.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n* Use a base font-size of 14px\r\n* Date formats should always be in the format “Jun 10”\r\n* The bottom toolbar should only ever have a maximum of 4 items\r\n* Never use the floating action button with the bottom toolbar\r\n* Chips should always come in sets of 3 or more\r\n* Don't use a dropdown if there are 2 or fewer options\r\n\r\nYou can also create sub sections and add more specific details\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n\r\n## Button\r\nThe Button component is a fundamental interactive element in our design system, designed to trigger actions or navigate\r\nusers through the application. It provides visual feedback and clear affordances to enhance user experience.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nButtons should be used for important actions that users need to take, such as form submissions, confirming choices,\r\nor initiating processes. They communicate interactivity and should have clear, action-oriented labels.\r\n\r\n### Variants\r\n* Primary Button\r\n  * Purpose : Used for the main action in a section or page\r\n  * Visual Style : Bold, filled with the primary brand color\r\n  * Usage : One primary button per section to guide users toward the most important action\r\n* Secondary Button\r\n  * Purpose : Used for alternative or supporting actions\r\n  * Visual Style : Outlined with the primary color, transparent background\r\n  * Usage : Can appear alongside a primary button for less important actions\r\n* Tertiary Button\r\n  * Purpose : Used for the least important actions\r\n  * Visual Style : Text-only with no border, using primary color\r\n  * Usage : For actions that should be available but not emphasized\r\n-->\r\n",
